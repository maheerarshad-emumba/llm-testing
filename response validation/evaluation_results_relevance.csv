How do recursive retrieval techniques help improve multi-step problem-solving?,"The provided context discusses Recursive Retrieval as a technique that iteratively refines the retrieval process to improve relevance and accuracy. It uses retrieved information to refine the input query or context, making it suitable for complex queries where initial retrievals may need further refinement. However, the context does not explicitly mention how recursive retrieval techniques help improve multi-step problem-solving. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information.",0.0,"Response Precision: 0.5{

Compare the context precision and context similarity scores for the HYDE and Subquery retrieval techniques.,"The context precision scores for HYDE and Subquery techniques can be found under the 'Context Precision' section. According to the provided context, the data of Subquery is 22% for Baseline Experiment, 51% for Multiquery, 29% for Subquery, 100% for HYDE, 44% for Multi step, 43% for Step back, and 49% for Query Rewriting. However, the 'Uptrain' and 'Tonic Validate' techniques do not provide context precision data for Subquery and HYDE in the given context.

For context similarity, the data for Subqueries is 82% for HYDE, 91% for Multi step, and 90% for Step back prompting. The context similarity data for other techniques, including the 'Ragas', 'DeepEval', 'Trulens', and 'Falcon-evaluate' techniques, do not directly compare HYDE and Subquery.

In conclusion, the context precision scores for HYDE and Subquery are available for some evaluation techniques, but not for 'Uptrain' and 'Tonic Validate'. The context similarity scores for Subqueries are available for HYDE, Multi step, and Step back prompting, but not directly comparable to Subquery for other evaluation techniques.",0.0,"Response Precision: 0.0{
