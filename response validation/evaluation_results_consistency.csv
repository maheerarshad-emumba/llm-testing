Model Size: 7B Embedding Dimension: 3584 Max Input Tokens: 32k Best Strategies to Select an Embedding Model MTEB Leaderboard on Hugging Face is a good starting point to shortlist the top notch models. However, it is still not a 100 percent accurate comparison as these results may vary with your dataset. A model with higher NDCG is better at ranking relevant items higher in the list of retrieved results. Model size has a direct impact on latency. The latency performance trade off becomes especially important in a production setup. Max tokens supported by a model indicate the number of tokens that can be compressed into a single embedding. Generally a model with 512 tokens is more than enough Smaller embeddings offer faster inference and are more storage efficient, while higher dimensions can capture nuanced details and relationships in the data. So it will be a trade-off between capturing the complexity of the data and operational efficiency.

How do recursive retrieval techniques help improve multi-step problem-solving?,"both gave us quite good results! Sentence Window Retrieval : Good for extracting specific lines or sections from PR descriptions, comments, or diffs that are relevant to a query Auto Merging Retrieval : Useful for combining information from multiple PRs, comments, and reviews to provide a comprehensive response Recursive Retrieval : Highly suitable for iterative queries where initial results may need further refinement, such as detailed PR review or code analysis They are provided by framework llama index, and can be integrated with any LLM and embedding model For sentence window retrieval, what if we consider base nodes as well? This May increase the performance even more We can not test Recursive as the pipeline does not give us the retrieved context, and evaluation matrix required that to generate a score, but in pdf based testing, there are scores defined for it because the pipeline used partially satisfies its concepts, that's why it is highlighted red as well but still its better than baseline experiment. Following techniques are implemented, there is a general overview, how these techniques work. Technique Description RAG use case Sentence Window Retrieval Segmenting the corpus into overlapping sentence windows and scoring based on query relevance. Scoring each window based on its relevance to the input query.

Auto Merging Retrieval Extracting relevant passages from multiple sources and combining them into a cohesive context. Automatically combining passages into a single context. Feeding the merged context Ideal for scenarios where information is scattered across different sources, like creating comprehensive reports synthesis from diverse documents. Recursive Retrieval Iteratively refining the retrieval process to improve relevance and accuracy. Using retrieved information to refine the input query or context.

However, it is still not a 100 percent accurate comparison as these results may vary with your dataset. A model with higher NDCG is better at ranking relevant items higher in the list of retrieved results. Model size has a direct impact on latency. The latency performance trade off becomes especially important in a production setup. Max tokens supported by a model indicate the number of tokens that can be compressed into a single embedding. Generally a model with 512 tokens is more than enough Smaller embeddings offer faster inference and are more storage efficient, while higher dimensions can capture nuanced details and relationships in the data. So it will be a trade-off between capturing the complexity of the data and operational efficiency.
