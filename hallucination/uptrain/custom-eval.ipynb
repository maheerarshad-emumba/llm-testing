The model incorporates several advancements Integration of bidirectional attention mechanisms, enriching its contextual understanding. Instruction tuning, applied solely on the query side for streamlined efficiency Comprehensive training across a vast, multilingual text corpus spanning diverse domains and scenarios. Model Size: 7B Embedding Dimension: 3584 Max Input Tokens: 32k Best Strategies to Select an Embedding Model MTEB Leaderboard on Hugging Face is a good starting point to shortlist the top notch models. However, it is still not a 100 percent accurate comparison as these results may vary with your dataset. A model with higher NDCG is better at ranking relevant items higher in the list of retrieved results. Model size has a direct impact on latency. The latency performance trade off becomes especially important in a production setup. Max tokens supported by a model indicate the number of tokens that can be compressed into a single embedding. Generally a model with 512 tokens is more than enough Smaller embeddings offer faster inference and are more storage efficient, while higher dimensions can capture nuanced details and relationships in the data. So it will be a trade-off between capturing the complexity of the data and operational efficiency. According to a research presented in this blog: https://towardsdatascience.com/openai-vs-open-source-multilingual-embedding-models-e5ccb7c90f05 for general text blobs Limited to 512 tokens Embedding Dimension: 768 Model Size 440 MB Multilingual BERT A multilingual version of BERT trained on 102 languages Used for scenarios where text of various languages exist Limited to 512 tokens Embedding Dimensions: 768 Model Size: 714 MB E5-Base A good general model for similarity search and downstream enrichment. Used for general text blobs Limited to 512 tokens Embedding Dimensions: 768 Model Size: 418 MB LED 16k A transformer model for very long text, based on BART Used for text up to 16384 tokens Limitation: Compressing 16kish words into 768 dimensions will surely be lossy Embedding Dimensions: 768 Model Size: 648 MB Voyage-Lite-02-Instruct Instruction tuned model from first generation of the Voyage family Used for instruction tuned for classification, clustering and sentence textual similarity tasks, which are the only recommended use cases. Limited to small text embedding model from second generation of Voyage family Embedding Dimension: 1024 Model Size: 1220 MB stella_en_1.5B_v5 Models is trained on Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5 and Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct Model is finally trained by MRL and they have multiple dimensions: 512, 768, 1024, 2048, 4086, 6144 and 8192. The higher the dimension, the better the performance.
