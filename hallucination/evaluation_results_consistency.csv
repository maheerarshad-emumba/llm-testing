Can Recursive Retrieval merge results from multiple domains like medicine and law?,"both gave us quite good results! Sentence Window Retrieval : Good for extracting specific lines or sections from PR descriptions, comments, or diffs that are relevant to a query Auto Merging Retrieval : Useful for combining information from multiple PRs, comments, and reviews to provide a comprehensive response Recursive Retrieval : Highly suitable for iterative queries where initial results may need further refinement, such as detailed PR review or code analysis They are provided by framework llama index, and can be integrated with any LLM and embedding model For sentence window retrieval, what if we consider base nodes as well? This May increase the performance even more We can not test Recursive as the pipeline does not give us the retrieved context, and evaluation matrix required that to generate a score, but in pdf based testing, there are scores defined for it because the pipeline used partially satisfies its concepts, that's why it is highlighted red as well but still its better than baseline experiment.
