0,Does GTE-Large support up to 8192 tokens in a single input like BGE-M3?,"No, GTE-Large does not support up to 8192 tokens in a single input. It is limited to 512 tokens. This information can be found in the context under the description for GTE-Large.","No, GTE Large supports upto 512 tokens",{'hallucination_score': 0.65}
1,Is BGE-M3 primarily used for summarization tasks?,"The provided context does not mention a model named ""BGE-M3"". Therefore, I cannot provide information on whether it is primarily used for summarization tasks.",No such information present in context,{'hallucination_score': 0.01}
2,Does GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct provide specialized support for legal document summarization?,"The provided context does not mention anything specific about GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct having specialized support for legal document summarization. It is a multilingual embedding model that supports more than 100 working languages and can process inputs of different granularities. It ranks first in both English and Chinese evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark. However, the context does not provide information about its applicability to legal document summarization.",No such information present in context,{'hallucination_score': 0.21}
3,Which model between GTE-Base and GTE-Large performs better for medical research document processing?,"The provided context does not include specific information about the performance of GTE-Base and GTE-Large on medical research document processing. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate comparison between these two models for this specific use case.",No such information present in context,{'hallucination_score': 0.05}
4,Does Recursive Retrieval allow token inputs over 32k?,"The provided context does not specify whether Recursive Retrieval allows token inputs over 32k. The maximum input tokens for GTE-Qwen2-7b-instruct, which is the model mentioned in the context, is 32k. However, there is no mention of Recursive Retrieval's specific capabilities in this regard.",No such information present in context,{'hallucination_score': 0.33}
5,Is there any embedding model specifically designed for handling tabular data?,The provided context does not mention any embedding model specifically designed for handling tabular data.,No such information present in context,{'hallucination_score': 0.03}
6,Does the GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct model have real-time processing capabilities for large datasets?,The context does not provide specific information about the real-time processing capabilities of the GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct model for large datasets.,No such information present in context,{'hallucination_score': 0.05}
7,Can Recursive Retrieval merge results from multiple domains like medicine and law?,"The context does not provide information on whether Recursive Retrieval can merge results from multiple domains like medicine and law. It only mentions that Recursive Retrieval is useful for iterative queries where initial results may need further refinement, and it can be integrated with any Language Model and embedding model.",No such information present in context,{'hallucination_score': 0.02}
8,Does BGE-M3 outperform GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct on multi-lingual benchmarks?,"The context does not provide a direct comparison between BGE-M3 and GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct on multilingual benchmarks. However, it mentions that BGE-M3 outperformed open AI models in terms of almost everything, and GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct is a model from the same category (open-source embedding models). Therefore, it can be inferred that BGE-M3 might outperform GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct on multilingual benchmarks, but there is no explicit statement in the context to confirm this.",It isn't specifically stated if BGE-M3 outperformed GTE-QWEN2-7B on multilingual benchmarks,{'hallucination_score': 0.32}
9,Are the Longformer Base 4096 and GTE-Large models frequently used together in multi-step pipelines?,The provided context does not mention or imply the frequent use of the Longformer Base 4096 and GTE-Large models together in multi-step pipelines.,No such information present in context,{'hallucination_score': 0.03}
