Multi-Linguality: It can support more than 100 working languages Multi-granularity: It is able to process inputs of different granularities, spanning from short sentences to long documents of up to 8192 tokens. Model Size: 2.2 GB GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct It ranks no.1 in both English and Chinese evaluations on the Massive text embedding benchmark. GTE-Qwen2-7b-instruct is trained on model based on the Qwen2-7b LLM Model. The model incorporates several advancements Integration of bidirectional attention mechanisms, enriching its contextual understanding. Instruction tuning, applied solely on the query side for streamlined efficiency Comprehensive training across a vast, multilingual text corpus spanning diverse domains and scenarios. Model Size: 7B Embedding Dimension: 3584 Max Input Tokens: 32k Best Strategies to Select an Embedding Model MTEB Leaderboard on Hugging Face is a good starting point to shortlist the top notch models. However, it is still not a 100 percent accurate comparison as these results may vary with your dataset. A model with higher NDCG is better at ranking relevant items higher in the list of retrieved results. Model size has a direct impact on latency. The latency performance trade off becomes especially important in a production setup. Max tokens supported by a model indicate the number of tokens that can be compressed into a single embedding. Generally a model with 512 tokens is more than enough Smaller embeddings offer faster inference and are more storage efficient, while higher dimensions can capture nuanced details and relationships in the data. So it will be a trade-off between capturing the complexity of the data and operational efficiency.
